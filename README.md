# Balatro-Demake
## Overview
This is meant to be the development version of a demake of the popular videogame Balatro, writen in lua and interpreted and packaged for the handheld console PlayStation Vita using [lpp-vita](https://github.com/Rinnegatamante/lpp-vita).

## Disclaimer
This is meant to be a personal coding project, meant to serve as an environment for experimentation and learning, not for general release. 

Therefore the code presented here may be prone to bugs or not working at all, developing for a 14 year old console with 512 MB of RAM is not the smothest thing in the world after all.


## Instalation
Place the contents of the repository inside the **build** folder in your **lpp-vita** instalation and generate your **.VPK** and transfer it to your console.
